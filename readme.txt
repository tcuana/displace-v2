Hi,

thank you for downloading. Have fun and tell your friends about us ;)

CSS
----------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes, you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released. If you want to change colour theme, change the CSS path in the <head> to e.g. css/style.red.css.

Javascript
----------

Apart from Bootstrap JS components majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. If you want to make any js settings finetuning, you can do it here.
